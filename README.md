## Introduction

VEX documents play a crucial role in the cybersecurity landscape. They provide essential information about vulnerabilities in software components. With **Go-Vex**, you can easily create and manipulate these documents, ensuring that your software is secure and compliant.

## Features

- **Easy Generation**: Quickly generate VEX documents with minimal setup.
- **Transformations**: Modify existing VEX documents to fit your needs.
- **Go Compatible**: Built specifically for the Go programming language, ensuring smooth integration.
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive documentation to help you get started.

## Installation

To install the **Go-Vex** module, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/TeachMark/go-vex
```

This command fetches the module and installs it in your Go workspace.

## Usage

Using **Go-Vex** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/TeachMark/go-vex"
)

func main() {
    vexDoc := vex.NewDocument("Example Document")
    vexDoc.AddVulnerability("CVE-2023-1234", "High", "Affected Component")
    
    fmt.Println(vexDoc.ToString())
}
```

This code creates a new VEX document and adds a vulnerability to it. You can customize it further based on your requirements.

## Examples

### Generating a Basic VEX Document

Hereâ€™s how you can generate a basic VEX document:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/TeachMark/go-vex"
)

func main() {
    vexDoc := vex.NewDocument("My VEX Document")
    vexDoc.AddVulnerability("CVE-2023-5678", "Medium", "Another Component")
    
    vexDoc.SetPublisher("Your Organization")
    vexDoc.SetPublishedDate("2023-10-01")
    
    fmt.Println(vexDoc.ToString())
}
```

### Transforming an Existing VEX Document

You can also transform an existing VEX document:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/TeachMark/go-vex"
)

func main() {
    existingDoc := vex.LoadFromFile("existing_vex.json")
    existingDoc.UpdateVulnerability("CVE-2023-5678", "Low")
    
    fmt.Println(existingDoc.ToString())
}
```
